# Known Issues — Prototype Leker

## Approval posting contract — resolved by V1

The posting-contract blocker introduced with approval queue 0013 is resolved by:

- `contracts/operational-posting-v1.md`;
- ADR-010;
- migration `0014_operational_posting_ledgers.sql`;
- `src/operational-posting.js`.

Current behavior:

- Kasir entry remains `pending_approval` + `unposted`;
- Admin Gerai can ACC/Reject only within its store;
- Owner can ACC/Reject across stores;
- ACC atomically writes the V1 domain movement and marks the approval `approved` + `posted`;
- failed non-negative stock/asset checks roll back the full batch and leave the request pending;
- CASH_FLOW affects drawer expected cash only after posting;
- GOODS_FLOW updates stock only after posting;
- ASSET updates aggregate asset-value ledger/balance only after posting.

V1 intentionally does not define canonical Accounting journal generation, lot/expiry, or individual asset depreciation.

## Manufacturing, stock, production, and moving-average HPP

Current behavior is governed by:

- `contracts/manufacturing-master-v1.md`;
- `contracts/stock-production-points-v2.md`;
- ADR-012, ADR-013, and ADR-015;
- migrations `0016_manufacturing_master_v1.sql`, `0017_product_stock_production_points.sql`, `0019_product_costing_and_kinds.sql`, and `0021_exact_production_costing.sql`;
- `src/manufacturing-master.js` and `src/stock-production.js`.

Current behavior:

- the legacy inventory engine still persists physical stock and recipe quantities as integer values;
- the approved MAXI canonical direction is fractional-capable exact decimal quantity; a dedicated compatibility migration remains required before changing the inventory source of truth;
- `inventory_stock_balances` is the current quantity source and `stock_movements` is the auditable movement history;
- manual Produksi and the legacy AUTO_DADAKAN path use the same production engine;
- tracked stock may not become negative;
- inventory purchases are itemized, select Product IDs from the store database, expose Qty explicitly, and create PURCHASE stock-in movements;
- `products.average_cost` is the running HPP source;
- `products.last_purchase_price` updates automatically from the newest itemized purchase;
- new authoritative unit-cost/HPP values use scaled INTEGER with `1,000,000` cost units per rupiah;
- purchase rows snapshot scaled average cost before/after;
- production components and runs use `*_scaled` exact integer HPP fields;
- legacy production REAL cost columns remain read-only history fallback and are not written by the new engine;
- sale items snapshot scaled unit HPP and line COGS so history is not recomputed from current master values;
- Admin has dedicated Stok and lazy transaction-detail read models.

### Open: canonical fractional inventory quantity migration

Current stock balances, stock movements, recipe quantities, purchase inventory quantities, sale quantities, and production quantities still use the legacy integer representation.

The approved target is one exact fractional-capable quantity model for all physical inventory, with unit-level decimal-scale validation. This requires a dedicated migration/compatibility plan so legacy quantity columns are not silently reinterpreted and no dual stock source is created.

Operational expense quantity is already stored as canonical decimal text because it is behavioural metadata and does not change inventory stock.

### Still intentionally open: Sale-level fulfillment migration

Mode Pemenuhan is no longer editable in Master Barang. The legacy `products.production_mode` column remains temporarily because existing sale execution still reads it.

A future Sale contract must move fulfillment ownership to the Penjualan transaction and define the requested default `DADAKAN`. Until that versioned migration is implemented, do not delete or reinterpret the legacy column and do not silently change existing sale behavior.

### Still intentionally open: Penyesuaian Stok write contract

The cashier Penyesuaian Stok entry point remains inactive until an explicit adjustment reason/audit/approval contract is defined. Future adjustment posting must reuse `stock_movements` and must not bypass the stock audit model.

## Product Master, Jenis Barang, Purchase Qty, and Operational Qty

Current behavior is governed by:

- `contracts/product-master-accounting-reference-v2.md`;
- ADR-015;
- migrations `0019_product_costing_and_kinds.sql`, `0020_expense_quantity_behavior.sql`, and `0021_exact_production_costing.sql`.

Current behavior:

- Master Barang edits product identity, Tipe Barang, Jenis Barang, Satuan Dasar, points, stock tracking, and Recipe Linked;
- Average Cost and Harga Beli Terakhir are automatic read-only fields;
- Jenis Barang is a separate user-defined classification with stable code and no invented seed values;
- Recipe Linked is explicit and same-store/output validated;
- product cost fields cannot be assigned directly through Product Master writes;
- Beli Bahan selects products from the active store Product Master database and requires explicit Qty per line;
- Pengeluaran Operasional stores explicit Qty, default `1`, as customer-behaviour metadata while its amount remains the total expense value;
- operational Qty alone never posts stock.

## Accounting Settings and Warehouse Settings — registry implemented, posting intentionally open

Current settings behavior is governed by:

- `contracts/accounting-settings-v1.md`;
- `contracts/warehouse-settings-v1.md`;
- ADR-016;
- migration `0022_accounting_warehouse_settings.sql`;
- `src/accounting-settings.js`;
- `src/warehouse-settings.js`;
- `public/admin-settings-panels.js`.

Implemented configuration:

- canonical local `chart_of_accounts`, `payment_methods`, `item_categories`, `transaction_categories`, and `journal_rules`;
- Chart of Accounts add/edit/deactivate with no hard-delete API and reference guard;
- Payment Methods select accounts from COA data;
- Jenis Barang links to Inventory/HPP/Revenue accounts through `item_categories`;
- transaction categories can contain multiple ordered Debit/Credit rule rows;
- structural `Lengkap` requires at least one active Debit and one active Credit;
- journal preview displays configured sources only;
- Warehouse Settings owns warehouse/location, staff access, and stock-opname parameters;
- Warehouse registers `wh_transfer`, `wh_opname`, `wh_production`, and `wh_return` into Accounting `transaction_categories`;
- Warehouse has no account-mapping table;
- adjustment accounts `4201 Pendapatan Koreksi Stok` and `6103 Beban Susut Persediaan` are marked `review_required=1`;
- `wh_return` remains deliberately without default rules until return direction/subtype is defined;
- old provisional pair-mapping writer is retired before this undeployed stack is promoted.

### Open: automatic journal generation and cross-program posting

Accounting Settings is configuration only. No engine currently:

- resolves a specific transaction's rule rows into final journal lines;
- calculates posting amounts from the rule registry;
- validates Accounting periods/dimensions for posting;
- sends a balanced journal command to the separate Accounting module;
- performs retry/reconciliation against Accounting.

That journal-generation/integration engine is a separate task after the Settings panels and rule semantics are reviewed. Prototype Leker must not write directly to the separate Accounting program database.

### Open: Stock Opname rule branch semantics

The default `wh_opname` category contains labeled gain and loss rule rows. A future journal engine must choose the correct branch from the actual signed adjustment and must never execute all four rows blindly. The two adjustment accounts require owner review before posting is enabled.

### Open: return taxonomy

`wh_return` is registered but fail-closed. Supplier return, customer return, and internal return can have different Accounting meaning, so no default rule is invented yet.

## Accounting integration seam

Prototype Leker still exposes `MAXI_ACCOUNTING_BUSINESS_FACT_V1` for operational business facts. Local configuration uses `MAXI_ACCOUNTING_SETTINGS_V1`.

`transaction_accounting_snapshots` records configuration readiness at operational fact creation but stores no fake debit/credit pair and no journal reference.

Current cross-program sync remains not connected. This does not block operational tracking or Settings configuration.

## Portal Staf V1

Live-photo attendance is active for authenticated cashier/employee sessions and is independent from drawer state. KPI, Riwayat Setoran, and Riwayat Gaji are intentionally exposed as isolated empty portal sections until their own versioned data contracts are implemented.

## Staff session dan duplicate tab

Canonical login remains separated into Pelanggan and Karyawan, one staff account has one active server session, and one browser has one active staff tab through the local browser lease. Customer sessions remain separate.

If browser-tab lease or takeover creates a new failure, record a new issue and do not restore tight periodic polling as a workaround.

## DOC-IMPACT

**REQUIRED** — Product Master/costing contracts, Accounting Settings v1, Warehouse Settings v1, ADR-015/016, migration 0022, and regression tests describe the active stacked draft. Remaining major work includes fractional inventory quantity migration, Sale fulfillment migration, Stock Adjustment execution, journal-generation/Accounting integration, Stock Opname posting semantics, return taxonomy, KPI, Deposit, and Payroll transaction implementations.
